# odin-recipes
This is my first project and is basically to show the skills honed while learning HTML
These includes creating the boilerplate, creating and nesting lists, embedding images and links
and lastly creating the recipe website
The recipes were extracted from the AllRecipes website advised by the Odin Project
Pictures were obtained from Pintrest and AllRecipes websites.
